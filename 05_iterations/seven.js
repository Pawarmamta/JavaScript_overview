/*.map() â†’ is used to perform some operation on every element of the array. It always returns a new array with the same length, where each element is the "transformed" version of the original.
ðŸ‘‰ In your case:
1st .map((num)=> num*10) multiplies each element by 10.
2nd .map((num)=> num+1) adds 1 to each result.

.filter() â†’ is used to check a condition on each element and keep only those elements where the condition is true. The result is a new array with fewer (or equal) elements.
ðŸ‘‰ In your case:
.filter((num)=> num>=40) keeps only the numbers greater than or equal to 40.*/
